# Auto Flag Controlling using IoT

The Automatic Flag Hoisting system is designed to ensure the dignity, respect, and proper handling of the national flag during unfavorable weather conditions.
This project is not aimed at reducing manual effort, but focuses on automatically de-hoisting the flag during rain, as keeping the flag hoisted in rainy conditions is considered disrespectful.

The system employs an ESP32 microcontroller as the central control unit, which manages the overall operation. A universal motor is used for hoisting and de-hoisting the flag, and its operation is controlled through relay modules interfaced with the ESP32. 
A rain sensor continuously monitors environmental conditions and provides real-time input to the controller. 

When rainfall is detected, the ESP32 immediately triggers the relay to activate the motor, ensuring automatic de-hoisting of the flag. This automated response helps protect the flag from damage and upholds its dignity without requiring human intervention during sudden weather changes.
